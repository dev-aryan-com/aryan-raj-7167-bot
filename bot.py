*School Life*

I am in 10th grade right now at Kendriya Vidyalaya.
It's a lovely school. It's infrastructure is really awesome.

I have many supportive friends.
We do fun all day in the classroom. We eat each other's lunches.
Sometimes we do fight but we get back soon üòÑ

Our class teacher is very good. He is a Maths teacher.
Sometimes he makes us bored ü•± 
But he teaches very well.

And you know an interesting fact, I am the tallest boy in my class üòè
I sit at the back bench. Yeah üòå I am back bencher.
My bench partner and I eat all our friends lunch üòÅ. You can say that we are foody guys.

And about my academics. I am an average student. I can be a topper but I don't study that much üôÇ. I perform well in my exams.

*Tech Journey*

I started coding in 7th grade. In 7th grade our computer teacher started teaching us HTML & CSS. At that time I got interested in coding.
I had a Lenovo Tablet. In which I started coding HTML codes. And on YouTube and the internet I started surfing about HTML and started learning from there.
I was too fast from my computer teacher syllabus. I learnt the whole HTML. Before she started CSS, I already completed it üòé.

Then I made some projects on Bootstrap. And started making the whole website from basic. 

And in 8th grade, I said to my parents to buy a keyboard and a mouse for coding. Then they bought it for me.
It was a big boost for me. After that I started making many websites and learning more.

After sometime I learnt Python from the Apna College YouTube channel. I want to thank Sharadha Didi for teaching me Python.

*This is the video link of that Python video: https://youtu.be/vLqTf2b6GZw?si=-9ZQwhnel82U0kNa*

And then I started making projects in Python.
